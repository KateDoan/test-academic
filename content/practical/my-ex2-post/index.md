# My link
Here I insert the link to a file. Remember to replace the example link by the permanent link to your file.

Once you have uploaded a file to GitHub, you can get the permanent link for the file by:
- Click on the file name
- Press y
- Get the permanent link for the file from the address bar of your browser. 
An example of the permanent link is:
https://github.com/KateDoan/test-academic/blob/2a4a09dfb61cfacf9761d8a3efdf871b988952b6/content/practical/my-ex2-post/chickenpox.xlsx

A permanent link should contain the complex alpha-numeric string such as `2a4a0...52b6` in the link above. If you don't see such a string in your link, then repeat the steps instructed above to get the permanent link.

# My code
R is very useful. You can print 1 to 10 easily with R.
```r
# Let's print from 1 to 10
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```
You can also define a function to print from 1 to 10.
```r
# Let's define a function
print_ten <- function () {
  for (i in 1:10) {
    print(i)
  }
}
```

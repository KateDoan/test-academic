# My code
R is very useful. You can print 1 to 10 easily with R.
```r
# Let's print from 1 to 10
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```
You can also define a function to print from 1 to 10.
```r
# Let's define a function
print_ten <- function () {
  for (i in 1:10) {
    print(i)
  }
}
```

# My list
1. Ordered item 1
1. Ordered item 2
* Unordered item 
* Unordered item
